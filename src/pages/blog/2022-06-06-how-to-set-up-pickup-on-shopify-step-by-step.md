## Deactivate locations

If you don't sell at a specific location, you can deactivate it permanently or temporarily. Once you deactivate a location, it won't appear in menus anymore. Hence, you won't be able to manage or move inventory there. You also won't be able to set it as your default location. You are required to set at least one location active. Deactivated locations don't add up to the number of your locations.

You cannot deactivate a location in case:

* For a location that is a private or 3rd app; Uninstall the app instead.
* For the default location; Change the default location to another one.
* For the location on the POS Pro subscription plan; Switch it to the POS Lite plan before deactivating it.
