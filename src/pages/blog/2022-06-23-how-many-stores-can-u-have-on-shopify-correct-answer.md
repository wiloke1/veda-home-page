**How many stores can u have on Shopify?** Let’s find out the answer. We also offer valuable pieces of advice to manage all of your stores successfully. Explore what should do and avoid when having multiple Shopify stores now!

## How many stores can u have on Shopify?

You are allowed to open more than 1 Shopify store with the same or different email credentials. However, you need a different account for each Shopify store. It means that you can pick a different plan for each.

And, each store can be accessed via a separate Shopify admin.  In case you have numerous stores linked to the same email, you could switch between them easily when you're in the Shopify admin.

## Why u should have many Shopify stores?

If you run a large business and intend to expand it globally, it’s worth your time and effort to open multiple online stores. There are many reasons why you should have many stores on Shopify

### Global expansion

When it comes to selling globally, the largest misconception eCommerce shops make is assuming that foreign shoppers would buy the same goods as ones in their hometown.

This isn't the reality. Instead, you should think about how people's buying patterns, consumer requirements, and lifestyle difficulties differ in various nations.

Running a distinct store for each nation is an excellent method to ensure that your store and offerings are tailored to each target audience segment. One of the best things about Shopify businesses is that you can establish each one to target a certain market.

If you're selling things in the United Kingdom, for example, you may have your store contain regionally-exclusive items with all prices in British pounds.

### Different customer targeting strategies

You might wish to set up several storefronts for each of your consumer groups if you are selling a wide range of items.

To illustrate, if you offer health products, you could set up a store for customers into bodybuilding supplements and another for those who prefer alternative cures and Eastern medicine.

### Sub-Branding And Outletting

When you have a lot of inventory, you would like to give it away at a big discount. If you do so, you are at risk of depreciating your brand. 

The viable solution is to build another different Shopify site. You can use that new site to offer an outlet for lower-quality or more inexpensive items. This allows you to reach more customers without jeopardizing your brand reputation.

## Obstacles when u should have many Shopify stores?

Although having different storefronts for multiple locations may appear to be a good idea, there are certain reasons why it might cause problems for your company.

This may be a time-consuming procedure that makes your company more exposed to security attacks. You can certainly monitor the data & structure for only 1 site if you're a tiny firm. That said, when your business expands with various items, you'll notice that product data gets more jumbled.

Organizing your product line data in a manner that makes sense across all online retailers is critical. You can observe which sales channels are working better in different nations if you implement this right and utilize Google Analytics.

If you offer certain things on both sites, you'll need to keep track of inventory when consumers buy and return items across the two Shopify businesses. Customers are irritated when they try to purchase something from one store only to discover that you've run out of it on the other.

It might be a pain to correctly manage inventory & multi orders when you have many Shopify sites all in the same warehouse. If you take my advice, you'll be able to avoid these frequent problems, allowing your eCommerce business to function smoothly.

When you collect this information, you can determine if it's worth it to retarget your business or open a new Shopify store to better target this demographic.

### Work on SEO continuously

You must consider the SEO of each store to ensure that your Shopify multi-stores are receiving the most visibility.

Employing free tools like Ubersuggest and Keywords Everywhere to compile a list of relevant, high-ranking keywords. After that, you should include keywords on landing pages in all of your stores:

* Headings
* Meta tags
* Image ALT text

To keep ahead of the pack, however, this must be a constant activity. Also, watch out for cannibalizing your keywords by using them to target several shops.

### Unify the way you manage orders

You'll need to figure out a means to consolidate your sales as well as manufacturing orders.  If you don't, you will face the chance of forgetting about orders, which will:

* Cause bottlenecks
* Lengthen lead times for manufacturing
* Damage the reputation of your company

### Benefit from the Shopify App Store

You can centralize many of your stores by installing the appropriate Shopify tools.

There are many excellent Shopify apps available that can help you automate business procedures for each of your businesses. Just keep in mind to look for a tool that may also assist you with manufacturing optimization.
