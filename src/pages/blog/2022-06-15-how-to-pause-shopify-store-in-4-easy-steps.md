4 easy steps - **how to pause Shopify store** is the topic of this blog. One of the most important aspects of running a successful online store is to pause your shop if you are not able to sell your products. Follow our suggestions so you can do this without harming your store's reputation.

## What is a Pause?

A pause is a temporary suspension of your Shopify store. You can use it to re-evaluate your business and make changes if you need to. A pause can be used for any number of reasons, including:

1) If you want to try something new with your product or service

2) If you want to take a break from running the business

3) If the products or services your business offers are seasonal.

## What are the Benefits of Pausing Shopify Store?

You might want to pause your Shopify store for a few days every now and then. This will give you the time to focus on other things like making sure that your website is up to date, your product pages are neatly designed, and that you don’t waste time on tasks that don't require your attention.

Pausing your Shopify store will allow you to take a break from running the business and have some time to do something else. It will also help you keep in mind what is really important in life so that you can come back refreshed when it's time for the business again.

## What Should Do Before Pausing Shopify Store

When you want to pause your Shopify store, it's important that you do it in a way that won't cause any damage to your store.

There are three easy steps to do before pausing your Shopify store:

* Have a backup of all of your data so that you can always start over if something goes wrong
* Get all of your content saved in an easily accessible place
* Have a plan for what will happen after the pause has ended.

All your installed apps will remain active even when you pause the store. If you want to pause any of your apps, then you should remove them from your list individually. It’s never a bad idea to uninstall apps with recurring charges before pausing your shop. It will make sure that you don't get charged unexpectedly.

## How to Pause Shopify Store in 4 easy steps

1. From the Shopify admin dashboard, select “Settings”
2. Click on “Users and Permissions” 
3. Scroll down to the section “Store status”, and choose “Pause store”
4. Read the terms carefully, then hit “Pause store”.

## What Happens When You Pause Shopify Store?

When you pause your Shopify store, it's not just like pausing a regular website. Your store is still online and there are many things that happen behind the scenes. The most important thing to know is that your customers will still be able to view your store, but they won't be able to make any purchases.

You might want to consider the Pause and Build plan if your store is seasonal, or only open for a specific amount of time.

One of the many perks of the Pause and Build plan is that it allows you to run your store on a smaller budget. You can continue running at a reduced cost of $9-14$ USD per month.

You can log into your Shopify admin and edit your products. However, Checkout functionality on your store is not currently available. This means that your customers can view the products, but they cannot make any purchases.

You can use a password to protect your online store to hide your products from customers when your shop is paused. If you're afraid of visitors misinterpreting that your store is closed forever, you can customize your store pause page to show a message.

The Pause and Build plan allows you to do the following:

* Visit the Shopify admin.
* See reports on your store's performance.
* View your storefront.

When your store is paused, it is impossible to maintain certain features such as discounts, POS, online store checkout, abandoned checkout recovery, gift cards, and third-party integrations. Sending drafts of order invoices is possible but customers can’t finish the checkout process.

Your Shopify shop will be on hold and run at a lower cost. In case you wish to re-start selling products, then you can open our existing store again at any time.

If you're on the Pause and Build plan, customers will still be able to view your items but won't be able to purchase anything at this time. To enhance customer experience, you should modify your current theme that hides product prices and the buy button so customers don't try to buy anything.

You should re-open your store when you're ready to sell again. To renew or change your plan, you'll need to log back in and choose a new plan.
