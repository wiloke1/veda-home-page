A simple and complete guide on **how to edit meta tags in Shopify**. Read this article to know how to write SEO-friendly meta tags to rank your store higher on search results.

A meta tag is a 155-160 character summary that explains the content of your webpage in HTML. In search engine results pages, the piece of the text shows beneath your page title.

Through a proper SEO strategy, your title tag and meta description will help your website to appear more prominently in search engine results. If the meta tag includes the target keywords, search engines display it in the search results.

Meta tags aren't an SEO ranking criterion, but they do persuade customers to click a page. Therefore, meta descriptions are an important aspect of on-page SEO. They appear as:

>  <meta name="description" content=, accompanied by the textual description.

The promise you offer to users is embodied in a meta tag. It stands out in a sea of rival websites and says, "This should be the site you're seeking for."

* Make a title that is distinctive and descriptive.
* Put your most critical target keywords towards the beginning of the title for each product, category, page, or blog post.
