If your business offers free shipping, you might need to delete the "shipping calculated at checkout" text. Otherwise, it leads buyers to believe that there may be extra shipping costs, causing them hesitant to complete the purchase, and lowering the conversion rate.

That’s why I write this post, intended for walking you through how to remove shipping calculated at checkout Shopify.

## Other Tips to Increase Your Shopify Sales

Besides offering free shipping, there are many ways that you can do to increase sales.

### Display product badges

Product badges such as On Sale, New Arrival, Best Seller, etc. can drive customers to add to the cart. Plus, they can easily find which products they are looking for. Product badges can also make the product page more visible and attractive.

### Offer discount codes by popups

A discount coupon is adored by everybody. Customers can't help but start figuring out how much money they'll save with your discount. Shopify enables you to give away discounts and award devoted clients. To make it more interesting, you can use Lucky Win Wheel popups to collect guests' emails and distribute coupon codes.

You may also choose whether the discount will be applied to the whole order or some particular goods. You may experiment to determine which discount will draw in most clients.

### Send cart abandonment emails

As a shopper, sometimes you shop for your desired products and add them to cart or Wishlist. However, you forgot to check out and make a payment. Some days later, you get an email reminding you that all of those goods are still available. And you say to yourself, "Why not?" That's why, as a merchant, it's a smart idea to make use of cart abandonment email reminders.

### Change the look of the collection & product page

You might be afraid that changing your current theme can cause losing some customization. However, with [Veda Builder](https://myshopkit.app/veda-builder-all-in-one-shopify-store-building-app/), you can override any page on your theme without losing customization.  

You are allowed to customize any element, block, and section to match their store's branding. You can do so more easily with the drop-drag menu and live preview editor. Furthermore, you can custom code and export code.
